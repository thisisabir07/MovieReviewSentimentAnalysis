## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews and classify them as either positive or negative. Using Python, the project leverages key libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and various machine learning models for classification. The notebook provides an end-to-end pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and tuning.

## Key Highlights

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Extensive preprocessing is conducted, including tokenization and handling missing values.
   - Utilizes data normalization techniques to prepare the text data for model training.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - Comprehensive EDA includes visualizations to understand sentiment distribution, common terms, and feature relationships.
   - Insights from EDA guide feature selection and model improvements.

3. **Models Implemented**:

   - Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to find the most accurate approach, including:
     - **KMeans Clustering**: For unsupervised classification and exploring patterns in sentiment.
     - **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: A deep learning model for non-linear relationships in data.
     - **Linear Regression**: Explored for regression tasks to understand feature impacts.
   - The use of multiple models allows a comparative study of their performances on sentiment analysis.

4. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**:

   - Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess each model's performance.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed to enhance model accuracy, with detailed performance analysis for each model.

5. **Final Model Selection**:

   - The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics, with additional tests on new data to ensure robustness.

6. **Results and Insights**:
   - The project provides insights into sentiment patterns, identifying words and phrases frequently associated with positive and negative sentiments.
   - Key findings from the analysis are documented to support potential use in other applications, such as movie recommendation systems or review platforms.

## Results

Each model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Here’s a summary of the results:

1. **KMeans Clustering**:

   - **Accuracy**: Moderate, given that KMeans is an unsupervised model.
   - **Insights**: Helped identify clusters within the data, but lacked the precision needed for sentiment classification.
   - **Limitations**: Since KMeans is not explicitly designed for binary sentiment classification, its accuracy was not as high as supervised models.

2. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**:

   - **Accuracy**: High, with an accuracy of around _X%_ (substitute with your result).
   - **Precision & Recall**: _Y%_ and _Z%_ respectively, indicating reliable performance on both positive and negative reviews (substitute values as applicable).
   - **F1-Score**: Achieved an F1-score of _W%_, making it the best-performing model among those tested.
   - **Strengths**: MLP effectively handled the non-linear relationships within the data, leading to higher overall performance.
   - **Limitations**: Requires more computational resources and tuning than simpler models.

3. **Linear Regression**:
   - **Accuracy**: Lower compared to MLP due to its linear nature, but still informative for understanding feature importance.
   - **Use Case**: Provided a baseline for comparison and insights into how certain features impact sentiment prediction.
   - **Limitations**: Due to its linear assumptions, Linear Regression was less effective for complex sentiment patterns.

## Future Scope

The project lays a foundation for more complex sentiment analysis tasks. Future improvements could include:

- **Advanced NLP Models**: Incorporating models like BERT or Transformer-based architectures.
- **Sentiment Intensity Analysis**: Extending the model to predict sentiment strength.
- **Deployment**: Converting the model to a web application for real-time sentiment analysis.
